## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## TAM's comments

Now if you need help with Quarto, you can find a lot [here](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/).

This [github](https://github.com/mcanouil/awesome-quarto) repository also includes extensive material of what others have done, videos, tutorials, templates, etc.

Look out for github actions which allows a document to be re-built every x minutes, updating e.g. a website.

```{r}
5+6
```
